### Do you use the Optional class as it should be(Mohamed Taman)

### Know the neighbours: dependency management done right(Brian Vermeer).
*Rate*: 🌟 :star2: 💪 :muscle:

*Feedback*: 
The hell of dependencies is relevant for Spring fans as well. 
It has sense checking for dependency updates in package management system from time-to-time to have it UP-TO-DATE.
The whole power of package manager system should be used to keep the dependency health - maven/gradle/npm.
F.e. in maven `mvn versions:display-depedency-updates`, `mvn dependency:analyse`, `mvn dependency:analyse -DignoreNonCompile ` and etc.
The rule: `PICK/UPDATE/REMOVE`.
