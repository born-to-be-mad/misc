Following books, articles, and links will cover all that is required for this exam. 
If you are preparing to take the 1Z0-816 exam, this path should help you pass 1Z0-816 exam:
- [ ] Start with any OCP JP 8 (1Z0-809) book such as 
  - [ ] [Boyarksy/Selikoff](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119067901/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ewhome-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1119067901&linkId=394d2034df2322c936e73206cc997d2f) 
  - [ ]  [Sierra/Bates](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119067901/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ewhome-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1119067901&linkId=d35ee432659d13ce49388919aab4ff7d).
  
!Ignore the following topics in these books:
 * Singleton/Immutability
 * static initializers/blocks
 * Date/Time related topics<BR/>

Following topics from the above books are mandatory to learn:
    - [ ] Lambda Expressions (including functional interfaces)
    - [ ] Parallel Streams
    - [ ] Lambda Operations on Streams
    - [ ] Language Enhancements - try with resources, multi catch
 Java File I/O (NIO.2)
- [ ] If you have time, go through these topics also (these are not explicitly mentioned in the objectives but are part of Concurrency):
  - [ ] java.util.concurrent.atomic package 
  - [ ] parallel Fork/Join Framework
- [ ] Study the following new topics from any Java 11 book such as [Core Java Vol 2](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0135166314/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ewhome-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0135166314&linkId=3a9e15ad39246637aa07466b16c67293) or [Herbert Schildt](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1260440230/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ewhome-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1260440230&linkId=36bafe62c000a21fd49de29474044dc5)
  - [ ] Create and use private, default, and static methods of interfaces
  - [ ] Create functional interfaces 
  - [ ] Use lambda expressions with type inferencing ( See [this](https://www.baeldung.com/java-10-local-variable-type-inference) and (this)[https://www.baeldung.com/java-var-lambda-params] article. )
  - [ ] Migration to Modular Application - Section 3 of [The State of Module System](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/spec/sotms/#compatibility--migration) (Read carefully)
  - [ ] Modular services - Section 4 of [The State of Module System](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/spec/sotms/#services) (Read carefully)
  - [ ] Serialization - Read Chapters 1, 2, and 3 of [Serialization Spec](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/platform/serialization/spec/serialTOC.html).
  - [ ] Security - Read Full [Secure Coding Guidelines](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/seccodeguide-139067.html).
  - [ ] JDBC - Any book will do. Focus on PreparedStatement. Ignore RowSets etc. 
  - [ ] Formatting - Date formatting has two different methods. 
  Using the old java.text package and using the new java.time.DateTimeFormatter package.  
  Not clear which one they are focussing on but there are questions on java.time.DateTimeFormatter for sure. 
  Either way, go through the Predefined Formatters and Pattern strings given in [DateTimeFormatter API JavaDoc](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html).
  - [ ] Annotations - Sufficient to go through this [trail](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/).
