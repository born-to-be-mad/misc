= GLOSSARY & TERMINOLOGY

*VPC peering*:: A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they were within the same network. You can create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs or with a VPC in another AWS account. The VPCs can be in different regions (also known as an inter-region VPC peering connection).

*VPC endpoint*:: A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink without requiring an Internet gateway, a NAT device, a VPN connection, or an AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network.

*PILLARS of Well-Architected Framework*:: The five pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework are (1) operational excellence, (2) security, (3) reliability, (4) performance efficiency, and (5) cost optimization.

*Traceability*:: The traceability characteristic falls under the *security* pillar.

*Role*:: A role is a powerful alternative to a specific user account. A role is often perfect for use in a scenario where one service must access another service.

*Federation*:: Federation is becoming more and more popular. You might access an AWS resource after being successfully authenticated by a social media domain, for example.

*Physical host security playbooks*:: Amazon DOES not typically provide to AWS customers in the area of compliance.

*Orchestration*:: Orchestration is often the result of sophisticated workflows and processes of many automated tasks and processes.

*Availability Zone (AZ)*::
* Each Availability Zone (AZ) is designed to be an independent failure domain.
* There is at least one discrete data center in an Availability Zone (AZ). Some AZs have more than one.
* The Availability Zone (AZ) location does not impact the cost of your EC2 resources.

*Security group*::
* Security groups permit you to control traffic to and from your EC2 instances. Remember that security groups are actually attached to the Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) that the EC2 instances use.
* Security groups are not instance specific. Therefore, one security group can be shared among many instances.

*AWS cost calculators*:: Two very popular cost calculators for AWS are TCO Calculator and AWS Simply Monthly Calculator.

*AWS fundamental costs*:: Compute, storage, and data transfer out are all fundamental costs in AWS.

*Spot instance*::
* Bidding on instances with spot pricing offers the largest potential savings.
* Spot allows AWS users to auction off unused reserved and scheduled instance hours to the highest bidder as a way to cut down on unnecessary expense.

*Technical account manager(TAM)*:: Consultative partnerships support specific use cases and applications and include design reviews and architectural guidance. The support team of an Enterprise-level customer includes a designated technical account manager and access to an AWS solutions architect. Only the Enterprise level of support provides TAM access.

*Free Tier*:: Iti 12 months. While SNS, Glacier, and CloudWatch can all remain free after the expiration of a Free Tier account, EC2 does not.

*AWS Forums*:: Forum access requires an AWS account—even a Free Tier account.

*Software as a Service(SaaS)*:: Gmail is an excellent example of Software as a Service.

*Auto Scaling*:: Three main components make up Auto Scaling: scaling plans, launch configurations, and groups.

*Bastion*:: A bastion server acts as a gateway and allows only privileged access to the servers. Using this gateway allows AWS to monitor, log, and control access.

*Scalability*:: Scalability is the ability of your infrastructure to grow on demand.

*Elasticity*:: Elasticity refers to the cloud’s ability to automatically scale as needed, based on demand.

*Elasticity*:: Elasticity (scalability) is cost-effective because you can spin up and pay for additional services as you need them (on demand), and it allows “on-ramping,” which means moving your services to the cloud over time gradually.

*Foundation services*:: Foundation services—the foundational services that AWS offers—include compute (EC2, Lambda, Auto Scaling), networking (Load-Balancing, Route53, VPC), and storage (S3, Block Storage, Glacier, EFS) services.

*NACL*:: Network Access Control Lists. NACLs, which are associated with subnets, give you a powerful security capability to control traffic between your AWS resources.

*Penetration testing*::  It may be performed by customers against their own instances with prior authorization from AWS. Currently, the permitted resources are EC2, RDS, Aurora, CloudFront, API Gateway, Lambda, Lightsail, and DNS Zone Walking.

*Provisioned IOPS*::
* Provisioned IOPS are a new Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume type designed to deliver predictable high performance for I/O-intensive workloads, such as database applications, that rely on consistent and fast response times.
* It is not a part of a Free Tier account.
* The supported volume size for a provisioned IOPS volume is 4 GB to 16 TB.
* The maximum IOPS per volume is 20,000 with this volume type.

*Snapshot*:: Snapshots allow you to create copies of volumes in other Availability Zones.

*Striping*:: RAID 0 (striping) can be used to increase performance in your data storage.

*Mirroring*:: RAID 1, or mirroring, makes a complete mirror of the source volume.

*Tags*::
* Tags enable you to categorize your AWS resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment.
* Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.

*CapEx vs OpExp*:: Cloud technology typically means you have lower `capital expenditures`(CapExp) and higher `operational expenditures`(OpExp).
