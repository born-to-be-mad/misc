#Glossary
* LGTM - Looks Good To Me
* ACK — acknowledgement, i.e. agreed/accepted change
* NACK/NAK —negative acknowledgement, i.e. disagree with change and/or concept  
* IMHO - In My Humble Opinion
* RFC — request for comments, i.e. I think this is a good idea, lets discuss
* WIP — work in progress, do not merge yet
* AFAIK/AFAICT — as far as I know / can tell
* IIRC — if I recall correctly
  
# Code review hints for reviewer
* Treat code reviews as a high priority
* Start high level and work your way down
* Be generous with code examples
* NEVER use the word “you” in a code review:
  * Replace ‘you’ with ‘we’
  * Remove the subject from the sentence
* Frame feedback as requests, not commands
* Tie notes to principles, not opinions
* Limit feedback on repeated patterns
* Respect the scope of the review
  * The rule of thumb is: if the changelist doesn’t touch the line, it’s out of scope!
* Look for opportunities to split up large reviews
* Offer sincere praise
* Grant approval when remaining fixes are trivialю
  Grant approval when any of the following are true:
  * You have no more notes.
  * Your remaining notes are for trivial issues.
  * Your remaining notes are optional suggestions.
* Handle stalemates proactively.
  Some indicators that you’re headed for a stalemate:
  * The tone of the discussion is growing tense or hostile.
  * Your notes per review round are not trending downward.
  * You’re getting pushback on an unusually high number of your notes.
* Talk it out
* Consider a design review
* Concede or Escalate
* Recovering from a stalemate
  * Discuss the situation with your manager
  * Take a break from each othe
  * Study conflict resolution

# Code review hints to make your Code Reviewer fall in love with you
* The golden rule: value your reviewer’s time
* Review your own code first
* Write a clear changelist description. A good changelist description explains what the change achieves, at a high level, and why you’re making this change.
  * [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit)
  * [My favourite Git commit](https://dhwthompson.com/2019/my-favourite-git-commit)  
* Automate the easy stuff
* Answer questions with the code itself
* Narrowly scope changes
* Separate functional and non-functional changes
* Break up large changelists
* Respond graciously to critiques
* Be patient when your reviewer is wrong
* Communicate your responses explicitly
* Artfully solicit missing information
* Award all ties to your reviewer
* Minimize lag between rounds of review

# CODE REVIEW CHECKLIST
*The main purpose of code reviews is to improve your codebase, improve your team's development skills, share knowledge, 
communicate, and — finally — write good code.*

* Be careful about code format. The team needs to agree on a format and everyone in the team should use that format.

* Ensure that proper naming conventions have been followed. <br/>Follow Java naming convention, f.e.. class names should start with capital letters, method names start with lowercase letters, etc.

* Remove comments if they give no information! Comments should explain why the code is written. Comments may also be used if there are complicated business rules or workaround solutions. Other comments should be removed.

* Attention should be paid to the architectural approach of the written code. The code should split into multiple layers. The MVC design pattern must be maintained and any parts that do not fit the layered architecture should be corrected.

* if there is a hard-coded variable in the code, it must be assigned to a constant or a configuration variable.

* Check that similar variables can be grouped under an enum.

* Verify that existing libraries/classes are used instead of writing code from scratch.
Anything should be removed if another library is used that does the same work as the existing libraries in the application.

*  The purpose of the written code should be understood from the related issue or the code itself. If no code belonging to the requested business rule has been written, it must be corrected.

* The code blocks should be concise. Make sure that the code is separated into blocks and each block has its own and only one responsibility. (Single Responsibility Principle)

* It's better to check whether SOLID principles are applied or not.***

* Code duplication should be checked, if there is a code written for the same purpose in the project, that code should be used or changed so that it can be used. (Don't Repeat Yourself)

* Edit any unreadable and not properly named code. The method or class name should describe its work correctly.

* Be sure that exceptions and errors are handled and logged properly. If the method returns an error code, check that if it describes the error properly.

* The code should be checked for security as possible as you can. Be aware of SQL Injection, XSS, Man in the middle, etc. Specifically, check the implementation behind the HTTP 3xx redirects.

* Performance controls should be done. Possible null pointer exceptions, cache errors, possible lazy initialization exceptions, String + String usages instead of StringBuilder should be fixed.

* checkstyle/ findbugs issues are resolved

# Code review checklist by categories
## Implementation
- [ ] Does this code change do what it is supposed to do?
- [ ] Can this solution be simplified?
- [ ] Does this change add unwanted compile-time or run-time dependencies?
- [ ] Was a framework, API, library, service used that should not be used?
- [ ] Was a framework, API, library, service not used that could improve the solution?
- [ ] Is the code at the right abstraction level?
- [ ] Is the code modular enough?
- [ ] Would you have solved the problem in a different way that is substantially better in terms of the code’s maintainability, readability, performance, security?
- [ ] Does similar functionality already exist in the codebase? If so, why isn’t this functionality reused?
- [ ] Are there any best practices, design patterns or language-specific patterns that could substantially improve this code?
- [ ] Does this code follow Object-Oriented Analysis and Design Principles, like SOLID(Single Responsibility Principle, Open-close principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation, Dependency Injection)?

- [ ] Is data retrieved from external APIs or libraries checked accordingly?

## Performance
- [ ] Do you think this code change will impact system performance in a negative way?
- [ ] Do you see any potential to improve the performance of the code?

## Readability
- [ ] Was the code easy to understand?
- [ ] Which parts were confusing to you and why?
- [ ] Can the readability of the code be improved by smaller methods?
- [ ] Can the readability of the code be improved by different function/method or variable names?
- [ ] Is the code located in the right file/folder/package?
- [ ] Do you think certain methods should be restructured to have a more intuitive control flow?
- [ ] Is the data flow understandable?
- [ ] Are there redundant comments?
- [ ] Could some comments convey the message better?

## Experts Opinion
- [ ] Do you think a specific expert, like a security expert or a usability expert, should look over the code before it can be committed?
- [ ] Will this code change impact different teams? Should they have a say on the change as well?

# What about coding styles and conventions?
*Cristal-clear coding styles can speed-up your code reviews. But, only if you automatically enforce them via tooling.*

_Crystal-clear coding style_ guides are the only way to enforce consistency in a codebase. 
And, consistency makes code reviews faster, allows people to change projects easily and keeps your codebase readable and maintainable.
